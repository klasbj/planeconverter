### Readme 

This application will take an old Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) 
and convert the file structure to the newer Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (MSFS) format
* Note: currently this does not convert any specific files, just creates and updates the MSFS's JSON files to read the older aircraft files.
	You likely will need to update the textures and gauges to make the plane functional.

## How To

Coming soon

## Known issues
* While converter will make these files readable by Microsoft Flight, it is very likely you will need to modify the textures
  and other resources to make it work properly.
* Non 3d gauges to not always translate over

## To Do

* Make a better ToDo list ^_^

## Prerequisits
* [.Net Framework 3.1 development tools ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=netcore31)
* [Visual Studio 2019 (Optional)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
